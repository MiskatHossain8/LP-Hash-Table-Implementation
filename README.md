# LP-Hash-Table-Implementation
This Linear Probing Hash Table implementation, developed for CSE207: Data Structures at East West University using C, supports insertion, deletion, searching, and display operations using the linear probing technique.

## 📌 Project Overview

The main objectives of this project are:

- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching
- Display

This project provides a concise, hands-on understanding of how a Linear Probing Hash Table works through practical programming.

## 🧠 Concepts Used

- A Linear Probing Hash Table is a hashing technique that uses open addressing to handle collisions.
- When a collision occurs, the algorithm checks the next consecutive slots until an empty position is found.
- The probing sequence follows a linear pattern (index + 1, index + 2, etc.).
- Insertion, searching, and deletion all use the same probing method.
